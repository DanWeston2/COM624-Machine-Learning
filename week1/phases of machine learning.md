phases of machine learning:

problem definition (define problem and define success in this scenario)

data collection (getting dataset)

data preparation (cleaning)

modelling and evaluation (create a machine learning model and evaluate its success)



Good data leads to useful insights whereas poor data can be misleading.

Data can be collected from:

* surveys and forms
* sensors and IoT devices
* databases and APIs
* public datasets



Three types of machine learning:

supervised (use labelled data to teach the model)

unsupervised (finds patterns in unlabelled data)

reinforcement learning (learns by trial and error using rewards and punishments)



Supervised:

predicts outcomes from set rules and can be divided into predicting categories (i.e. pass/fail\_ or quantities (i.e. percentage scores)



Unsupervised:

discovers hidden patterns



Reinforcements:

an agent interacts with an environment, receiving rewards or punishments.



Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA is the process of analysing datasets to summarise their main characteristics, often using visual methods. It helps us understand the data, spot patterns, and identify issues before building models.



Two approaches to data analysis:

Descriptive analysis - summarises data

Inferential analysis - makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample



Objectives of EDA:

Understand structure and distribution of the data

Detect Anomalies such as missing values or outliers

Test Assumptions and see if the data matches the model requirements

Find Relationships between variables



Types of EDA:

Univariate non-graphical examines one variable at a time using statistics like mean, median and mode

Univariate graphical uses plots such as histograms, box plots and line charts for single variables

Multivariate non graphical analyses relationships between variables using statistics

Multivariate graphical analyses relationships between variables using plots



EDA Steps:

Source the data

Clean the data

Visualise the data
